**Date:** January 4, 2026

## 🚨 URGENT: Custody Rule Compliance

### Current Violation Risk
**If operating as RIA:** Holding client crypto assets in consumer wallets (MetaMask, Phantom) **VIOLATES SEC Custody Rule**.

**SEC Rule 206(4)-2:** Investment advisers with custody of client funds/securities must use a qualified custodian.

---

## 📊 Current Holdings Assessment

### Your Crypto Holdings (Non-Qualified Custody)
| Asset | Amount | Current Location | Status | Risk Level |
|-------|--------|------------------|--------|------------|
| ETH | 2.5 | MetaMask (Consumer Wallet) | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| SOL | 100 | Phantom (Consumer Wallet) | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| BTC | 0.1 | Coinbase | ⚠️ VERIFY | 🟡 MEDIUM |

**BTC Address:** `1Ak2fc5N2q4imYxqVMqBNEQDFq8J2Zs9TZ`

### Valuation (Approximate)
- **ETH:** 2.5 × $3,500 = ~$8,750
- **SOL:** 100 × $100 = ~$10,000
- **BTC:** 0.1 × $45,000 = ~$4,500
- **Total:** ~$23,250
