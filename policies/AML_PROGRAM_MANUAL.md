## 8. Currency Transaction Report (CTR) Filing

### A. Legal Requirement

**31 CFR § 1010.311** requires financial institutions to file a **Currency Transaction Report (CTR)** for any **cash transaction** exceeding **$10,000** in a single day.

### B. CTR Filing Thresholds

**File CTR for:**
- Cash deposit of **$10,000 or more**
- Cash withdrawal of **$10,000 or more**
- **Aggregated cash transactions** totaling **$10,000 or more** in a single business day by/for the same customer

**Examples:**
- Customer deposits $6,000 cash in morning, $5,000 cash in afternoon → **CTR REQUIRED** (total $11,000)
- Customer withdraws $9,500 cash → No CTR required (but monitor for structuring)
- Customer deposits $10,000 check → **No CTR** (check is not cash/currency)

**Definition of "Currency":**
- ✅ U.S. paper bills and coins
- ✅ Foreign currency (euros, pesos, yen)
- ❌ Checks, money orders, cashier's checks (these are monetary instruments, not currency)
- ❌ Wire transfers (not cash)

### C. CTR Filing Form

**FinCEN Form 112** - Currency Transaction Report

**Required Information:**
- Customer information (name, DOB, SSN, address, occupation, employer)
- Transaction details (date, amount, type - deposit/withdrawal)
- Account information (account number, account type)
- **Person conducting transaction** (if different from customer)

### D. CTR Filing Deadline

File CTR within **15 calendar days** of the cash transaction.

**Filing Method:**
- Electronic filing via FinCEN BSA E-Filing System: https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov

### E. Multiple Transactions (Aggregation Rule)

If customer conducts multiple cash transactions in a single business day totaling **$10,000 or more**, the Firm aggregates them and files a **single CTR** for the total amount.

**Example:**
- 9:00 AM: $4,000 cash deposit
- 11:00 AM: $3,500 cash deposit
- 2:00 PM: $3,000 cash deposit
- **Total: $10,500** → File CTR for $10,500

### F. Structuring (Illegal Evasion of CTR Requirement)

**31 U.S.C. § 5324** makes it a federal crime to structure transactions to evade CTR reporting.

**Red Flags for Structuring:**
- Multiple cash transactions just below $10,000 (e.g., $9,000, $9,500, $9,800)
- Customer specifically requests to keep transaction below $10,000
- Customer asks questions about CTR reporting threshold
- Customer splits cash deposit between multiple accounts

**If Structuring Suspected:**
1. ✅ **File CTR anyway** (even if individual transactions below $10,000)
2. ✅ **File SAR** for structuring (see Section 7)
3. ✅ **Continue monitoring** account for additional structuring
4. ✅ **Do NOT warn customer** that structuring is illegal (tipping off)

## 14. Special Considerations for Crypto Assets

### A. AML Risks for Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency presents unique AML risks:

- **Pseudonymity:** Wallet addresses not directly linked to customer identity
- **Mixers/Tumblers:** Services that obscure source of funds (Tornado Cash, Blender.io)
- **Privacy Coins:** Cryptocurrencies designed for anonymity (Monero, Zcash)
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):** No KYC/AML controls
- **Cross-Border:** Instant global transfers without intermediaries
- **Darknet Markets:** Illicit marketplaces using crypto

### B. Blockchain Analytics

The Firm uses blockchain analytics tools to monitor crypto transactions:

**Recommended Providers:**
- Chainalysis (AML compliance, sanctions screening)
- Elliptic (transaction monitoring, wallet screening)
- CipherTrace (risk scoring, exchange screening)

**Use Cases:**
- Screen incoming crypto deposits for links to mixers, darknet markets, sanctioned addresses
- Trace source of funds for large crypto deposits (>$10K)
- Monitor customer crypto withdrawals for suspicious destinations
- Generate risk scores for crypto addresses

### C. Red Flags for Crypto AML

**High-Risk Crypto Activity:**
- ✅ Deposit from **mixer/tumbler** (Tornado Cash, Blender.io, ChipMixer)
- ✅ Deposit from **darknet market** address (Silk Road, AlphaBay)
- ✅ Use of **privacy coins** (Monero, Zcash) for large transactions
- ✅ **Rapid conversion** of crypto to fiat + immediate withdrawal
- ✅ **Layering:** Multiple crypto-to-crypto conversions to obscure source
- ✅ Deposit from **OFAC-sanctioned address** (North Korean, ransomware wallets)

**If Red Flag Detected:**
1. ✅ **Freeze account** (prevent withdrawals)
2. ✅ **Conduct investigation** (blockchain tracing)
3. ✅ **Request customer explanation**
4. ✅ **File SAR if appropriate**
5. ✅ **OFAC screening** if sanctioned address suspected

### D. Qualified Custodian Reliance

If the Firm uses a **qualified custodian** for crypto custody (Coinbase Custody, Fidelity Digital Assets, Anchorage, BitGo Trust), the Firm may **rely** on the custodian's AML/KYC procedures for:

- Screening incoming crypto deposits
- Monitoring for sanctioned addresses
- Blockchain analytics

**Requirements for Reliance:**
- Written agreement with custodian documenting AML responsibilities
- Annual review of custodian's AML program
- The Firm maintains **ultimate responsibility** for AML compliance

### E. Crypto Travel Rule

See Section 9 (Travel Rule Compliance) for crypto-specific Travel Rule requirements.

**Summary:**
- Crypto transfers ≥**$1,000 USD** equivalent subject to Travel Rule
- Collect and transmit originator/beneficiary information
- Use TRUST protocol or similar solution

### F. Unhosted Wallet Monitoring

When customer transfers crypto to **unhosted wallet** (personal hardware wallet, self-custody):

1. ✅ **Customer attestation:** Verify wallet is owned by customer (not third party)
2. ✅ **Wallet address collection:** Record public wallet address
3. ✅ **Monitoring:** Periodically check blockchain for activity from that address
4. ✅ **Risk flag:** If customer transfers to mixer/darknet market after withdrawal
