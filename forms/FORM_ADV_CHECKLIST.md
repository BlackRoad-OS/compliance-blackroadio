# Form ADV Preparation Checklist
**RIA Registration - SEC or State**
**Devereux - Chief Compliance Officer**
**Date:** January 4, 2026

---

## 📋 Overview

Form ADV is the **uniform form** used by investment advisers to register with both the SEC and state securities authorities. It consists of two parts:

- **Part 1:** Information about the adviser's business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and disciplinary events
- **Part 2:** The "brochure" - narrative disclosures for clients about advisory services, fees, conflicts of interest, disciplinary information, and other matters

---

## 🎯 Decision Point: SEC vs State Registration

### SEC Registration (Form ADV filed with SEC)
**Required if:**
- Assets Under Management (AUM) **≥ $110 million**
- OR adviser to registered investment company (mutual fund)
- OR adviser to business development company

**Benefits:**
- Single federal registration
- Uniform standards across states
- Less restrictive advertising rules

### State Registration (Form ADV filed with State)
**Required if:**
- AUM **< $100 million**
- AND no SEC exemptions apply
- Must register in each state where required

**Note:** Between $100M-110M = adviser's choice (SEC or State)
